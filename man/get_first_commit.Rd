\title{Find the first GitHub commit introducing a function}
\usage{
get_first_commit(
  owner,
  repo,
  function_name,
  path = NULL,
  pattern = NULL,
  branch = NULL,
  max_commits = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{owner}{GitHub repository owner (e.g. \code{"tidyverse"}).}

\item{repo}{GitHub repository name (e.g. \code{"ggplot2"}).}

\item{function_name}{Name of the function to search for.}

\item{path}{Optional file path within the repository. Supplying this avoids
code search and is recommended when renames are suspected.}

\item{pattern}{Optional regular expression used to match file contents.
Defaults to matching R-style function definitions.}

\item{branch}{Reserved for future use.}

\item{max_commits}{Maximum number of commits to inspect before giving up.}
}
\value{
A one-row data frame with commit metadata (\code{commit}, \code{date}, \code{author},
\code{message}, \code{url}, \code{file}), or \code{NULL} if no match is found.
}
\description{
Searches a GitHub repository for the \emph{earliest commit} in which a function
appears in a given file, based on file contents at each commit. This is a
GitHub-API-based approximation of:
}
\details{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{git log -S <function>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

and does \strong{not} require a local clone.
\subsection{How it works}{
\enumerate{
\item If \code{path} is not supplied, GitHub code search is used to identify a
candidate file containing \code{function_name}.
\item The commit history for that file path is retrieved via the GitHub API.
\item File contents are fetched at each commit and searched for \code{pattern}.
\item The earliest matching commit is returned.
}
}

\subsection{Important limitations}{

GitHub does \strong{not} expose:
\itemize{
\item content-based history search
\item rename tracking
\item cross-file symbol history
}

As a result, this function may fail to find the \emph{true} first introduction if:
\itemize{
\item the function moved between files
\item the file was renamed or deleted
\item the symbol appeared earlier in a different path
}

For historically exact results, a local clone and
\verb{git log -S} are required.
