\title{Find the first GitHub commit introducing a function}
\usage{
get_first_commit(
  owner,
  repo,
  function_name,
  path = NULL,
  pattern = NULL,
  branch = NULL,
  max_commits = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{owner}{GitHub repository owner (e.g. \code{"tidyverse"}).}

\item{repo}{GitHub repository name (e.g. \code{"ggplot2"}).}

\item{function_name}{Name of the function to search for.}

\item{path}{Optional file path within the repository. Supplying this avoids
code search and is recommended when renames are suspected.}

\item{pattern}{Optional regular expression used to match file contents.
Defaults to matching R-style function definitions.}

\item{branch}{Currently ignored (reserved for future use).}

\item{max_commits}{Maximum number of commits to inspect before giving up.}
}
\value{
A one-row data frame with commit metadata (\code{commit}, \code{date}, \code{author},
\code{message}, \code{url}, \code{file}), or \code{NULL} if no match is found.
}
\description{
Finds the earliest commit in which a function appears in a file, using the
GitHub API. This is a GitHub-based approximation of:
}
\details{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{git log -S <function>
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

and does \strong{not} require a local clone.
\subsection{Method}{
\itemize{
\item If \code{path} is not supplied, GitHub code search is used to select a candidate
file containing \code{function_name} (currently restricted to R files).
\item The commit history for that file path is retrieved.
\item File contents at each commit are searched for \code{pattern}.
\item The earliest matching commit for that file path is returned.
}
}

\subsection{Limitations}{

GitHub does not expose content-based history search or rename tracking.
Results may be incomplete if the function moved between files, the file was
renamed or deleted, or the wrong file is selected when \code{path = NULL}.

For exact historical results, use a local clone and \verb{git log -S}.
