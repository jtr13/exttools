\title{Convert GitHub Pages URLs to GitHub repository URLs}
\usage{
github_pages_to_repo(url)
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A character vector of URLs. Each element may be a GitHub
Pages URL or any other URL.}
}
\value{
A character vector of URLs of the same length as \code{url}. GitHub
Pages URLs are converted to GitHub repository URLs; all other URLs
are returned as-is.
}
\description{
Transforms GitHub Pages URLs of the form
\verb{https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/} into the corresponding
GitHub repository URLs:
\verb{https://github.com/<user>/<repo>}.
}
\details{
Non–GitHub Pages URLs are returned unchanged.

This function detects GitHub Pages URLs using the pattern
\verb{https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/}. Only user-level Pages URLs that
include a repository path are converted. Root Pages URLs such as
\verb{https://<user>.github.io/} are left unchanged, as they do not map
unambiguously to a single repository.
